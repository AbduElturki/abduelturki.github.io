career-profile:
    title: About me 
    summary: |
      Member of the Engineering Team at [Graphcore](https://graphcore.ai) working in Silicon Design Verification, where the main programming languages are Python and C++. My main career interests are Computer Architecture, Digital Signal Processing, Low-Level Programming, and High Performance Computing.

      Graduated with First Class Honours in MEng Computer Science and Electronics at [University of Bristol](https://bristol.ac.uk) in 2019. During my time at university, I have accomplished the best project in the department in my 3rd and 4th years. I was part of the [Computer Science Society](https://cssbristol.co.uk/) committee for two years as a press officer and the president of the Computer gaming Society.       

      Prior to starting my university degree, I have obtained an International Foundation degree in Engineering at the University of [Brighton International College](https://www.kaplanpathways.com/colleges/university-of-brighton-international-college/).
      My early education was in Libya, as I have lived there for 17 years.

       Verification Engineer. The main programming languages are C++ and Python. My current responsibilities are:
          - Modeling parts of an IPU in C++ to test the RTL if meets the specification of the architecture.
          - Creating a packet generator in Python to simulate IPU packet transactions so it can be used for the C++ model and the RTL.
          - Contribute to the design specification of upcoming chips.

    - role: Software Engineer Intern
      time: July 2019 - Aug 2019
      company: QLM Technology LTD, Bristol UK 
      details: |
       Internship after graduating and before starting my career at Graphcore. During my time at QLM I have accomplished the following:
          - Optimized existing Matlab code 80x speed up by rewriting it in Julia combined with calls to C functions and utilizing parallel programming. 
          - Created tools and libraries for the host machine to communicate with an FPGA.
          - Provided better workflow for the company with version control using Git, writing documentation, and using open source languages and tools.

    - role: Research Engineer (Machine Learning) 
      time: Jan 2018 - Mar 2019
      company: Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol UK 
      details: |
       From Jan 2018 to Sep 2018 I was working full-time at Toshiba as Research Engineer in Machine learning as part of my undergraduate degree. Afterward, I have worked part-time while completing my degree. 
          - Invented and filed a patent of a system that reduces network traffic by 60% of Distributed Neural Networks by using Reinforcement Learning.
          - Used machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow on Embedded devices like NVIDIA Jetson to simulate IoT networks.
          - Produced demos using JavaScript and ReactJS so they can be used for general meetings and conferences.
