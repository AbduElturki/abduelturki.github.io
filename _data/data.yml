    title: About me 
    summary: |
      I'm a University of Bristol Graduate in Computer Science & Electronics with a
      deep interest in Computer Architecture, HPC, DSP, and Scientific and low-level Programming.
      In my free time, I like reading about CPU/GPU specifications sheets and learn how they work, where
      my favourite project is simulator of an out-of-order non-blocking CPU.
      In my career, I have a experience in low-level/real-time programming, working on embedded devices
      such as NVIDIA Jetson, Texus Instruments C6678 DSP, and various different FPGAs.
      Currently, I'm working for [Graphcore](https://graphcore.ai) 
      as a graduate member of the silicon team, rotating into
      physical design, verification, and RTL teams.

    - role: Embedded Software Engineer
      time: July 2019 - Aug 2019
      company: QLM Technology LTD, Bristol UK 
      details: |
       Contract summer job after graduating and before starting my career at Graphcore. During my time at QLM I have accomplished the following
          - Optimized existing Matlab code 80x speed up by rewriting it in Julia combined with calls to C functions and utilizing parallel programming. 
          - Created tools and library for the host machine to communicate with a FPGA.
          - Provided better work flow for the company with version control using Git, writing documentations and using open source languages and tools.

    - role: Research Engineer (Machine Learning) 
      time: Jan 2018 - Mar 2019
      company: Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol UK 
      details: |
       From Jan 2018 to Sep 2018 I was working fulltime at Toshiba as Research Engineer in Machine learning. Afterwards I was working part time while finishing my masters degree. During my time there I have accomplished the following.
          - Invented and filed a patent of a system that reduces network traffic by 60% of Distributed Neural Network by using Reinforcement Learning.
          - Used machine learning library such as Tensorflow on Embedded devices like NVIDIA Jetson to simulate IoT networks.
          - Produced demos using JavaScript and ReactJS so it can be used for general meetings and conferences.

        tagline: "Collaborative University Project on optimisng disparity algorithm C code. We were able to make the code run 20 times faster by reducing loops and adding pragma optimisation, while preventing race condition. We also wrote assembly code to compare the performacne, which made our project one of the highest marked in the unit."
